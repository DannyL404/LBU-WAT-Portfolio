# Welcome to Dan's Dinnerz

Dan's Dinnerz is a website designed to provide simple recipes for people that want to make simple food, fast! 

I designed a brand identity for the company with Adobe Express. This included the colour scheme and the logo. The design and branding kit for this can be seen here: https://new.express.adobe.com/id/urn:aaid:sc:EU:7143f242-bf94-486c-883b-d039fb87082a?invite=true&promoid=YXPZFV9S&mv=other

I have then developed the project using HTML, CSS and the Django framework. I have accessed a range of sources to complete this website including
